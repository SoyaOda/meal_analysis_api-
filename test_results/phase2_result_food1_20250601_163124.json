(2) The branded nature of this entry often provides comprehensive nutritional data for a prepared dish. (3) It was preferred over other branded Caesar salad entries that included additional ingredients not present in the observed salad (e.g., tomatoes, kale) or were specifically 'pasta salad' variants.
