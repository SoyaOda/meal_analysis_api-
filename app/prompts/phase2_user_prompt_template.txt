Above is the initial AI analysis of the meal.

USDA food database candidate information for the items in the initial analysis and potentially for the overall dishes:
{usda_candidates}

Based on all this information (initial analysis, USDA candidates, and implicitly the image context from the initial analysis), please refine the analysis. For each dish/food item:
1. Determine its `calculation_strategy` ('dish_level' or 'ingredient_level').
2. Provide the `fdc_id` and `usda_source_description` according to that strategy, as detailed in the system instructions.
Remember to follow the JSON schema strictly. Do not calculate or return any nutritional values.
