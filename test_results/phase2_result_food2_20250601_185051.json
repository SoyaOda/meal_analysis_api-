      "reason_for_choice": "Selected FDC ID 168952 (Rice and vermicelli mix, rice pilaf flavor, prepared with 80% margarine) because: (1) It is an SR Legacy entry, providing a reliable and generic nutritional profile for prepared rice pilaf. (2) The description explicitly includes 'vermicelli mix' and 'prepared', which aligns well with the visual characteristics of rice pilaf. (3) It is a more compositionally specific and prepared-state-aligned option compared to generic branded 'Rice Pilaf' entries which might be dry mixes.",
