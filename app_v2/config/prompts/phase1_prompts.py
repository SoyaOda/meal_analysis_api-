IMPORTANT: You MUST provide ALL responses in English only. This includes dish names, ingredient names, and any other text fields.

Please note the following:
1. Focus on accurate identification of dishes and ingredients, not quantities or weights.
2. Use clear, searchable names that would likely be found in the USDA food database.
3. Identify all dishes present in the image and their key ingredients.
4. There may be multiple dishes in a single image, so provide information about each dish and its ingredients separately.
5. Your output will be used for USDA database searches, so use standard, common food names.
6. Strictly follow the provided JSON schema in your response.
7. ALL text must be in English (dish names, ingredient names, etc.).
8. Do NOT include quantities, weights, portion sizes, or dish types - focus only on identification."""
