      "reason_for_strategy": "The initial branded search for 'La Madeleine Caesar Salad' yielded no direct results. However, several suitable generic branded 'CAESAR SALAD' options were found. Choosing a dish-level strategy, specifically a branded food entry, is preferred for common prepared dishes like Caesar salad when a good compositional match is available. This approach leverages manufacturer-provided data, offering a more precise and representative nutritional profile for the entire pre-prepared salad compared to an ingredient-level calculation, which would require summing potentially less representative individual component data.",

FDC ID 1916135, 'CAESAR SALAD' by Taylor Fresh Foods, Inc., was selected as the best available branded dish-level match. This FDC ID is a Branded Food type, which is prioritized for specific products. Its partial ingredient list (Romaine lettuce, Caesar dressing, Parmesan cheese) aligns well with the components of the described Caesar Salad, indicating a strong compositional match. This choice provides a comprehensive nutritional profile for the entire salad as a single unit, which is more stable and representative than summing individual ingredients for a common prepared dish.",
